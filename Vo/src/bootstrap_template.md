# Onboarding Checklist

Track what Vo still needs to learn about the user. Check items off as they're discovered naturally through conversation. Don't interrogate — weave questions into helpful interactions.

When all items are checked, onboarding is complete. Update the user profile with everything learned.

## Essentials
- [ ] Name and how they prefer to be addressed
- [ ] Location / timezone
- [ ] What they do (role, occupation, field)

## Goals & Priorities
- [ ] Primary current goal or focus
- [ ] What "making progress" looks like for them right now
- [ ] Any deadlines or time pressure

## Work Style
- [ ] Preferred communication style (concise vs detailed, formal vs casual)
- [ ] How they like to receive suggestions (options vs recommendations)
- [ ] When they're typically active / available

## Context
- [ ] Key projects or work streams in flight
- [ ] Tools, languages, or platforms they use regularly
- [ ] Any recurring frustrations or blockers

## Personal
- [ ] Interests or topics they follow
- [ ] Anything they've explicitly asked Vo to remember
